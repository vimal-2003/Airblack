## Features
- Responsive design
- Implementation of sections like community, get certified, and join Airblack
- Use of modern React.js practices and components

## Project Structure
- **src**
  - **components**: Contains React components used in the project.
    - `App.js`: Main component rendering other components.
    - `CommunitySection.js`: Component for the community section.
    - `GetCertifiedSection.js`: Component for the get certified section.
    - `JoinAirblackSection.js`: Component for the join Airblack section.
  - **css**: Contains CSS files for styling components.
    - `App.css`: CSS styles for the App component.
  - `index.js`: Entry point of the React app.
- `index.html`: HTML template file.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## How it Works
- The `App` component serves as the main component that renders other components.
- Each section of the Airblack website (community, get certified, join Airblack) is represented by a separate component (`CommunitySection`, `GetCertifiedSection`, `JoinAirblackSection`).
- CSS files (`App.css`) contain styles for respective components.
- `index.js` is the entry point of the React app, rendering the `App` component into the root HTML element.

## Technical Details
- **Framework**: React.js
- **Styling**: CSS
- **Version Control**: Git
- **Hosting**: N/A (for local development)
- **Dependencies**: React, react-dom, etc. (specified in `package.json`)
